<p>During Highschool I played basketball, lacrosse, and football and was also the captain of the football team. From the time  was a freshman to a Senior the football team went from not having a win to having a winning record and making the playoffs.</p>
<p>I played Running back, reciever, corner back, and linebacker.</p>
